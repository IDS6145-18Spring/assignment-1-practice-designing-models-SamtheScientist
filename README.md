## General Introduction

A **smart city** is an urban area that uses different types of electronic data collection sensors to supply information which is used to manage assets and resources efficiently.

Violent crimes possess the capacity to devastate the lives of both victims and their families as well as reduce the number of productive members in society through either death or disability. However, this proposal outlines a system designed to facilitate crime reduction through the use of human-robot mixed teams and more specifically, the *Robotic Perceptual and Processing System* (RPPS). The RPPS is a robotic system intended to enable human social cue perception and mental state evaluation through the use of sensor suites coupled with statistical analysis. 

The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program (U.S. Department of Justice, 2017) defines violent crime as “offenses that involve force or threat of force”. Specifically, the offenses that constitute violent crime are: (a) murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, (b) rape, (c) robbery, and (d) aggravated assault. According to the FBI’s uniform crime reporting program (U.S. Department of Justice—Federal Bureau of Investigation, 2017), the estimated number of violent crimes rose 4.1% from 2015 to 2016.

When on patrol, police officers are required to be capable of making increasingly complex judgments when it comes to tracking and identifying other humans. As a result, they are able to identify potential problems, whether it be a citizen in distress or an individual about to commit, or in the process of committing a crime. Given this, it stands to reason that officers engage in the attribution of mental states (i.e., emotions, intentions, beliefs) while involved in these tasks. However, humans are prone to error throughout the decision-making process, which is why this proposal will outline a robotic system capable of removing human error from the equation and indirectly affecting crime rates.


## Requirements (Experimental Design)

The Robot Perceptual and Processing System would be designed such that it would offer three distinct capabilities: 
1. Function as an integrated social cue perception and social signal interpretation system
2. Support the capability of unique human recognition
3. Enable the ability to measure precise temperature gradients and link these to human social signals

*Hypothesis 1.* Utilizing a mid-wave infrared sensor, the RPPS will detect social cues expressed by humans based on infrared emission measurement. Additionally, it will be able to map facial capillaries based on IR emissivity. Mid-wave infrared sensors will enable the RPPS to perceive the infrared radiation generated by the activation of muscles and blood flow as a function of expressed social cues. The resolution in mid-wave infrared sensors varies according to the size (in degrees) of the field of view under current examination. Concurrent with this is also the robotic platform’s proximity to the human currently under surveillance. A sensor test will confirm correct calibrations to enable the proper sensitivity and specificity levels required to detect social cues. Contrast ratios will be assessed before purchase.

*Hypothesis 2.* Use of the RPPS by police forces will influence the incidence of violent crime, by facilitating robotic perception and interpretation of human social cues and signals. The purpose of the RPPS is to support the use of robotic teammates alongside human interactors by reducing error in judgment tasks and facilitating improved safety, efficiency, effectiveness, and objective completion. 
Individual task completion and overall objective completion will be measured during which the RPPS will be utilized alongside a police squad participating in a mock scenario. An identical mock scenario, with a participating police squad, will be used as a control. Within these scenarios, safety will be measured on the condition of police/bystander casualty/injury events, efficiency will be measured as a function of time, effectiveness can be evaluated in terms of cognitive workload assessment, and objective completion will be measured in terms of objectives met/tasks completed.


## Smart City Robot Perceptual and Processing System (RPPS) Model

At a high level, the *Robot Perceptual and Processing System*, or RPPS, is composed of a robotic platform equipped with a sensor suite, artificial intelligence module, and database access modules.

## Smart City Robot Perceptual and Processing System (RPPS) Simulation

[**Simulation Overview**](analysis/README.md) 

Given that the use of passive infrared sensors for facial recognition and expression recognition is currently rare in practice, establishment of its appropriateness for use in the RPPS should be the first step. Presently, these types of sensors have been employed in a select few cases for facial recognition (Bourlai, Ross, Chen, & Hornak, 2012) and facial expression recognition (Wang, Shen, & Liu, 2012). Additionally, Khan, Ward, and Ingleby (2009) have employed infrared thermography in a robotic platform to aid in emotion attribution. However, to the best of my knowledge, mid-wave infrared sensors have never been used in this capacity. 

On the other hand, the unique facial recognition module that has been proposed for the RPPS, would leverage the structure of human facial capillaries to achieve recognition success, given that facial capillaries are biologically unique to each individual, and would enable differentiation from person to person. Previous research has explored several different techniques for instantiating such a mechanism (e.g., Buddharaju, Pavlidis, Tsiamyrtzis, & Bazakos, 2007; Koukiou, & Anastassopoulos, 2015; see Ghiass, Arandjelovic, Bendada, & Maldague, 2014 and Unar, Seng, & Abbasi, 2014 for a review).

Lastly, once the appropriateness of the sensor suite has been established, the primary concern would be the performance of the Brunswikian Lens model (Cooksey, 1996; Doherty & Kurz, 1996; Hammond, 1993; Vicente, 2003). This model is key to the RPPS’s ability to interpret social cues and comes to meaningful conclusions about the social signals conveyed by human interactors. To accurately simulate the three aforementioned problems, continuous-based simulations would be most appropriate.
